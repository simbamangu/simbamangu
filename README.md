Habari, dunia? I'm a conservation biologist based in Tanzania, specialising in aerial surveys of large mammals. 

Currently working on:

- Detection of things in aerial photos using machine learning.
- FILTERING the photos that 'have things' in them so humans can count and annotate more quickly (we're now collecting hundreds of thousands of images on a typical survey!).
- Testing whether oblique or nadir imagery is superior.
- Building open hardware for data collection.
